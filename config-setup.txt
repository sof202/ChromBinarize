# It mainly consists of file paths and data specific features. Some defaults

# Thresholds on the read depth considered for filtering input bed files
# Max read depth is included due to

# Thresholds for creating 'good reference datasets' for obtaining value of p
# that is used in binomial distribution (look at README.md for more info)

# read depth and less sites at high levels of hydroxymethylation (for ONT data).
